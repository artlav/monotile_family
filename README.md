# Generating the monotile family
In section 6 of the paper "An aperiodic monotile" authors describe how you can construct a continuum of aperiodic monotiles, which i find a bit more interesting than the hat and turtle everyone is crazy about.

However, i wasn't able to find any code that generates 3D printable models for any of the non-standard ones, so i had to make it myself.

This is an OpenSCAD file that generates an arbitrary Tile(a,b), normalized to defined scale.

Enjoy your tiling.
